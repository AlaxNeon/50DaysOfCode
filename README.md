## Day 1
# 🚀 50 Days of Code — Day 1

Welcome to **Day 1** of my #50DaysOfCode challenge!  
Today’s focus was on problem-solving, logic building, and deepening my understanding of **Data Structures & Algorithms** through five LeetCode problems.

## 🧩 Problem 1 — Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions  
**LeetCode 2300 | Medium**

### 🔍 Problem Description  
You are given two integer arrays `spells` and `potions` and an integer `success`.  
A pair `(spell, potion)` is **successful** if `spell * potion >= success`.  
For each spell, return the number of potions that make it successful.

### 💡 Approach  
- Sort the `potions` array.  
- For each spell, use **binary search** to find the first potion that meets or exceeds the success threshold.  
- Count all potions from that point onward.  
- Time complexity: `O((m + n) log n)`.

### 💻 Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] successfulPairs(int[] spells, int[] potions, long success) {
        Arrays.sort(potions);
        int n = potions.length;
        int[] result = new int[spells.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < spells.length; i++) {
            int left = 0, right = n - 1, index = n;
            while (left <= right) {
                int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
                if ((long) spells[i] * potions[mid] >= success) {
                    index = mid;
                    right = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            result[i] = n - index;
        }
        return result;
    }
}

## 🧩 Problem 2 — Water Bottles  
**LeetCode 1518 | Easy**

### 🔍 Problem Description  
You have `numBottles` full water bottles and an exchange rate `numExchange`.  
You can drink one bottle at a time and exchange empty bottles for new full ones.  
Find the **maximum number of bottles you can drink**.

### 💡 Approach  
- Keep track of total bottles drunk and empty bottles.  
- While empty bottles ≥ `numExchange`, exchange them for full bottles.  
- Add the newly acquired full bottles to the total and update empty bottles accordingly.

### 💻 Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int total = numBottles;
        int empty = numBottles;
        while (empty >= numExchange) {
            int newBottles = empty / numExchange;
            total += newBottles;
            empty = newBottles + empty % numExchange;
        }
        return total;
    }
}

## 🧩 Problem 3 — Two Sum  
**LeetCode 1 | Easy**

### 🔍 Problem Description  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`,  
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

### 💡 Approach  
- Use a **HashMap** to store each element and its index.  
- For each element, check if `target - nums[i]` already exists in the map.  
- Return indices when found.  
- Time complexity: `O(n)`.

### 💻 Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}

**LeetCode 1 | Easy**

### 🔍 Problem Description  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`,  
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

### 💡 Approach  
- Use a **HashMap** to store each element and its index.

- Return indices when found.  
- Time complexity: `O(n)`.

### 💻 Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}

## 🧩 Problem 5 — Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  
**LeetCode 3 | Medium**

### 🔍 Problem Description  
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

### 💡 Approach  
- Use a **sliding window** with a `HashSet` to track characters in the current window.  
- Move the right pointer until a duplicate is found, then move the left pointer to remove the duplicate.  
- Keep updating the maximum length found.  
- Time complexity: `O(n)`.

### 💻 Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        int left = 0, maxLen = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            while (set.contains(s.charAt(right))) {
                set.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }
            set.add(s.charAt(right));
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
}
